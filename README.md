<h2>**Emoji classification using unsupervised learning**</h2>

Emojis have rapidly grown in popularity in the age of the smart phone. These internet colloquialism have permeated modern conversation, but their meaning can be difficult to decipher, often times used because of their ambiguity. 

Fortunately, emojis are commonly used in online chat rooms, giving us an abundance of use case scenarios to process. Hundreds of thousands of people tune in every day to watch ‘steamers’ live-stream content, and viewers can talk to each other and their favorite streamer through a chatroom.

Using sentiment analysis, I will try to infer emoji sentiment based on surrounding context. Text based sentiment analysis will work as a fall back project. Chat text can easily be saved as text files through an IRC client. The logs of several different streaming communities can be compared to see how emoji use differs across communities. 

<h2>**Intel Image Classification**</h2>

Using a kaggle data set of labeled images, I will use a CNN to classify images. After the model is trained, I would like to apply the model to images of objects or scenery not included in the set to see how the model performs.
